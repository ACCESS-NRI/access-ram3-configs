## Getting involved in ACCESS-rAM3

There are several ways we welcome feedback and contributions on ACCESS-rAM3 development. **Contributions from people of all career stages and backgrounds are highly encouraged.** The models and configurations we develop are under the MOSRS license. Development is led by the [Momentum Partnership](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/momentum-partnership).  ACCESS-NRI tailors the development to run on the Australian [Gadi](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/0.+Welcome+to+Gadi#id-0.WelcometoGadi-Overview) Supercomputer, using datasets available to all Australian researchers.
