# Single-level nest example

To modify the starting example to run a single-level nest rather than a double level nest, you only need to modify the RNS.

To open the rose GUI, run the following command from within the RNS suite directory:

```
rose edit
```

Navigate to suite-conf &rarr;  Nesting Suite &rarr;  Nested region 1 setup 

Change the `rg01_nreslns` field to 1 and click the _Save_ button ![Save button](/assets/save_button.png){: style="height:1em"}.

The single-level nest will default to the GAL9 nest1 of the pre-filled Lismore example.
